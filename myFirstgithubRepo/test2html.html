<P> Welcome to my travel blog, Love Travelling.  I’m Marion, an award winning independent traveller writing about my visits to countries near and far.</P>

 <P> I research destinations myself and that’s part of the fun – visiting the local library and selecting some travel guides, looking things up online and, of course, all the amazing tips I discover from fellow travel bloggers.</P>
 <P><B>The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.

<p> My passion is travel,  I just love visiting new places, immersing myself into local cultures of life around the world and discovering the unexpected!  Stepping off a plane, I’m always in a hurry to get my passport stamped, reclaim my luggage and walk out of the arrivals hall ready to begin a new adventure.</p>

<p>I love the planning, the anticipation, the journey, be it by plane, train, bus or boat and of course, the actual holiday and finally all the wonderful memories and experiences I bring home that live with me forever.  That was the original reason why I created this blog so that I could have an online diary of my recent trips to look back on in the future.  I’ve been surprised but thrilled that so many of you have taken an interest in my travels and enjoy reading about my trips – it’s very encouraging and makes me very happy!  From starting as a hobby my blog has evolved into an award winning online travel resource providing inspiration to fellow travellers.</p>

<P> I didn’t set foot on foreign soil until the age of 13, on a school holiday to the Black Forest in Germany, travelling by coach and ferry.  I adored everything about that first trip, from the little things like driving off the ferry on the other side of the road, the strange money and the language, and I knew from that day on, that I wanted to explore as many different countries as time and money would allow and to experience local cultures first hand.  I’ve been fortunate in being able to fulfil my dream and to share my love of travel with my family but, naturally, there are so many destinations still out there waiting to be explored.</P>
<P> <B> Travel as much as you can, as far as you can, as long as you can. Life’s not meant to be lived in one place</B></P>
<P> The countries I’ve been fortunate to visit to date are:

  Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Jersey, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malaysia, Malta, Morocco, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Vatican City.</P>

<p class="as"> As well as overseas travel, I’m also a firm supporter and champion of the British Isles.  From dynamic cities to rural towns and villages and from seaside resorts to national parks there is so much to enjoy and be proud of.  Within this section of my blog I explore short breaks and days out at places of interest.</p>
<p>Hopefully, drawing on my personal experiences, I may be able to pass on some useful insights and travel tips to help you get the most out of your holidays and perhaps inspire some of you to visit destinations that you might not previously have thought of.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I’m already looking forward to sharing my travel stories and photos with you.  Do come along and join my adventures!</p>

<p>2018 I won an international travel blog contest and my prize was a four day visit to the Finnish city of Tampere.  Since returning from Tampere I have been privileged to take on the role of international ambassador to promote tourism in this part of western Finland.</p>
