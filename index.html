  <h1 class=" heading" > It's about us</h1>
  <div class=" first-section"> 
  <p> I'm David Leiter, the guy behind this website. I'm an American who's been traveling the world full time for 9 years now.</p>
<p> I started this travel blog in 2019 to document my own international trips, share my photos, and help others learn how to travel the world and find some really good spots off the beaten path.</p>
<p> All of the writing and pictures on this site come from my own personal experience.</p>
 
<p> I'm currently based in <b>Bali, Indonesia,</b> where I met my wife Intan, who’s a Bali local. Now she joins me on these adventures too.</p>
<p>Together, we've done some bucket list hikes, climbed active volcanoes, seen exotic wildlife, and visited some spectacular castles, temples, and monuments around the world.</p>

  <h2> Heading two</h2> 
 <div class="second-section">
<p>
  It’s hard to make a list of the best things to do in<strong> Japan,</strong> because there are just so many cool and fun activities in this country.
</p>
<p> Every island in Japan is interesting, but as a first timer, many of the best sights and activities for tourists are in the cities of Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo.</p>
<p> There’s a huge variety of cultural attractions here, both old and new. You can ride a futuristic bullet train through the city and then explore an ancient temple or Samurai castle in the same day.</p>
<p>
  We’ve visited Japan a bunch of times over the years, but it never gets old. It’s one of our favorite countries in the world to travel.

<h3> Third heading</h3>
<p> I experienced the 7.0 <b>Lombok earthquake in Indonesia</b> in 2018, the bombings in Bangkok in 2019, and a fair share of scams, fights, sicknesses, car accidents, and other crazy things along the way.
  It hasn't always been easy, but over the years I've been blessed with some amazing experiences, including:
</p>

  In 2018, I traveled to 24 countries in one year, which is a personal record so far! I did this on a pretty modest budget and rarely spent more than $30/day on my travels, including lodging and food.I haven't been everywhere, but it's on my list! I'm always looking for new adventures.
</p>
<p>
  I hope my travel blog can help and inspire you in your own journeys as well!
